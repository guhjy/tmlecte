Title: Estimates the NDE and ATT with TMLE
Type: Package
LazyLoad: yes
Author: Sam Lendle <lendle@stat.berkeley.edu>
Description: Estimates the Average Treatment effect among the Treated
    (ATT), or among the not treated. The latter is the same statistical
    parameter as the Natural Direct Effect (NDE) when there is no
    baseline confounding for either the treatment, A, or the
    mediator(s)/intermediate variable(s), Z. When there is/are (a)
    baseline confounder(s) (W), the "NDE among the not treated" is
    estimated. In the case of a randomized trial, this is equivalent to
    the NDE, because P(W|A)=P(W).  In this case, the NDE can be
    efficiently estimated were both Z and W have large dimensions. This
    is a working package.  The methods in this package will likely be
    made available in the tmle package on CRAN in the future.
