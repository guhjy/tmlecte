 This R package estimates the statistical parameter `E(E(Y|A=1,B)-E(Y|A=0,B)|A=a)` using targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE).  If `A` is a treatment, then this is sort like a Treatment Effect, Conditional on one of the treatments, hence the (possibly temporary) name `tmlecte`.  Under various causal models, this statistical parameter has interpretations of things like the affect of treatment among the treated (ATT) and the natural direct effect (NDE). 

To install, I recommend installing the `devtools` package, available on CRAN, then use the function `install_github("tmlecte", "lendle")`.  Alternatively you could download the source or clone it with git, then `R CMD BUILD` and `R CMD INSTALL` it.  You probably shouldn't do either right now though since I'm not really done yet.
